## Development setup

### Prerequisites

`LibreOffice` is required for automatically generating `PDF` slides from `ODF` files. If you don't have it installed, you can find the instructions in the [official download page](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/).

### Git hooks

This repository uses git hooks to automatically generate `PDF`s from slides. To set them up, run:

```bash
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```
